💬 Real-Time Chat with WebSocket
👋 Welcome!

We are pleased to present the project "Real-Time Chat with WebSocket", developed as part of a practical study on bidirectional communication between client and server, using Node.js, WebSocket, HTML, and CSS.

🧩 Challenge
The challenge of this project was to implement a functional chat capable of sending and receiving messages instantly between multiple connected users.
⚡ This task required the use of real-time communication protocols and the integration between back-end and front-end to ensure immediate message updates.

⚙️ The System
To achieve our goal, we used the following technologies and tools:

Node.js – To manage the server and WebSocket connections.

WebSocket (ws) – Library for real-time bidirectional communication.

HTML & CSS – Structure and style of the chat interface.

JavaScript (Front-end) – Interface manipulation and sending/receiving messages.

The system allows:

📝 Sending messages in real time.

📡 Instant receiving of messages from other users.

👥 Multiple users connected simultaneously.

🎨 Simple and responsive interface for easy interaction.

🚀 Results
The result is a functional chat that can serve as a foundation for more complex applications, such as private rooms, user authentication, and database integration for message history.
